    "In the previous mission, we learned how to use the apply(), map(), and applymap() methods to apply a function to a series. While we could certainly use these methods to clean strings in columns, pandas has built in many vectorized string methods that can perform these tasks quicker and with less keystrokes.\n",

    "Removing strings or substrings from a series\n",
    "As we learn these tasks, we'll also work to build intuition around how these string methods operate so that you can explore methods we haven't explicitly covered on your own.\n",
